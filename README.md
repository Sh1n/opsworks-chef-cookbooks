# AWS OpstWorks PHP Cookbooks. 
> #NOTE
>
> I'm currently working on version 2 of this cookbook. In version 2  most of the cookbooks included here will be broken down into small repositories added as dependencies via Berkshelf. Several Cookbooks have been deprecated and will not be part of version 2, these include adwords and fuel. Please use the taged releases and avoid referencing the branches directly OR use the branch `1.x`.

# Cookbooks

##AdWords
This cookbook contains a recipe to place a configuration file in a location of your choosing with in the deployment directory. 

###adwords::auth_config

```
{ 
    "custom_env": {
        "app_name": {
            "adwords": {
                "path_to_auth": "app/config",
                "developer_token": "ThisIsTheDeveloperToken",
                "user_agent": "Custom User Agent",
                "client_id": "clientid.apps.googleusercontent.com",
                "client_secret": "ClientSecret",
                "refresh_token": "RefreshToken-MustBeRequested"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Use on **setup**. The name of the authentication file will be auth.ini and will look like this:

```
developerToken = "ThisIsTheDeveloperToken"
userAgent = "Custom User Agent"

[OAUTH2]

client_id = "clientid.apps.googleusercontent.com"
client_secret = "ClientSecret"

; If you already have a refresh token, enter it below. Otherwise run
; GetRefreshToken.php.
refresh_token = "RefreshToken-MustBeRequested"

```

##phpenv
This cookbook contains utility recipes to help setup applications.

###phpenv::memoryswap
AWS micro instances have little memory (615 MB), and can often times run out of memory. 
I have run into memory issues when doing composer installs or updates. 

Use recipe on **Setup** ONLY.

See these references for more info:

###phpenv::php_mcrypt_enable
This recipe should only be used with the OpsWorks OS Package php5-mcrypt in Ubuntu 14.04. This package is not enable by default and the purpose of this recipe is to run `php5enmod mcrypt` if the file `mcrypt.ini` exisists with in `/etc/php5/mods-available/`.

Use recipe on **Setup** ONLY.

###phpenv::php_mongodb
This recipe installs the mongodb php module using PECL (Requires the **php-pear** OS package). 

Use recipe on **Setup** ONLY.

###phpenv::php_redis
This recipe installs the redis php module using PECL (Requires the **php-pear** OS package). 

Use recipe on **Setup** ONLY.

###phpenv::htaccess_env_vars
This recipe creates a custom .htaccess in the directory of your choice and sets
environment variables using the apache setEnv directive. A default .htaccess file is
provided with this recipe, but a custom .htaccess file can be used. 
The recipe can create a unique .htaccess file for each application in the stack. 
Two configuration values are required to make this recipe work: ```htaccess_template``` for example htaccess.rb, 
and ```path_to_vars``` This is the path where the htaccess file will be created. 
The evironment variables can be set in the custom Chef JSON like this:

```
{
    "custom_env": {
        "staging_site": {
            "environment": "staging",
            "htaccess_template": "htaccess.rb",
            "path_to_vars": "web",
            "env_vars" : [ 
                "CACHE_TIME 3600", 
                "SOME_API_KEY BlahBlah", 
                "ANOTHER_API_KEY helloWorld!" 
            ] 
        },
        "production_site": {
            "environment": "production",
            "htaccess_template": "advanced_htaccess.rb",
            "path_to_vars": "public",
            "env_vars" : [ 
                "CACHE_TIME 1234", 
                "SOME_API_KEY nahnah", 
                "ANOTHER_API_KEY hello-monkey!" 
            ] 
        }
    }
}
```

The name custom_env is required. The values staging_site and production_site are the applications created in this stack and
must match the application name.

The array of values ```"env_vars"``` will have any environment variable needed to run the application. The format is

"KEY value" (KEY space VALUE)

in the example above the production site $_SERVER array would look like this:

```php
Array
(
//... 
    [ANOTHER_API_KEY] => hello-monkey!
    [GA_API_CACHE_TIME] => 1234
    [SOME_API_KEY] => nahnah
//... 
)
```

**NOTE: THE RECIPE WILL NOT WORK IF YOUR APPLICATION NAME HAS SPACES OR DASHES "-" BETWEEN WORDS. Use underscores "_" to separate words to avoid problems**
**NOTE2: THESE ENVIRONMENT VALUES WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE IN THE TERMINAL. ANY TASKS YOU RUN FROM THE TERMINAL MUST SET THE EVIRONMENT NAME**
The .htaccess generated by this recipe will look like this:

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine on 
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f 
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d 
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L] 
  
  <IfModule mod_env.c> 
    # Environment Variables for application production_site 
    SetEnv ANOTHER_API_KEY hello-monkey! 
    SetEnv GA_API_CACHE_TIME 1234 
    SetEnv SOME_API_KEY nahnah 
  </IfModule> 
</IfModule>
```

###phpenv::php_env_vars
This recipe creates a custom ```environment_variables.php``` in the directory of your choice and sets
environment variables using the [putenv](http://php.net/manual/en/function.putenv.php) function. 
In order to use this file and have the env vars available on every request, the file must be 
included each time. The recipe can create a unique file for each application in the stack. 
One configuration values is required to make this recipe work: ```path_to_vars```. 
This is the path where the ```environment_variales.php``` file will be created. 

The evironment variables can be set in the custom Chef JSON like this:

```
{
    "custom_env": {
        "staging_site": {
            "environment": "staging",
            "path_to_vars": "src/acme/application/config/staging",
            "env_vars" : [ 
                "CACHE_TIME=3600", 
                "SOME_API_KEY=BlahBlah", 
                "ANOTHER_API_KEY=helloWorld!" 
            ] 
        },
        "production_site": {
            "htaccess_template": "advanced_htaccess.rb",
            "path_to_vars": "src/acme/application/config/production",
            "env_vars" : [ 
                "CACHE_TIME=1234", 
                "SOME_API_KEY=nahnah", 
                "ANOTHER_API_KEY=hello-monkey!" 
            ] 
        }
    }
}
```

The name custom_env is required. The values staging_site and production_site are the applications created in this stack and
must match the application name.

The array of values ```"env_vars"``` will have any environment variable needed to run the application. The format is

"KEY=value" 


Note that in this case we do not add an environment value for FUEL_ENV, this is 
because the recipe will use the application value ```environment``` to set it. 

**NOTE: THE RECIPE WILL NOT WORK IF YOUR APPLICATION NAME HAS SPACES OR DASHES "-" BETWEEN WORDS. Use underscores "_" to separate words to avoid problems**
**NOTE2: THESE ENVIRONMENT VALUES WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE IN THE TERMINAL. ANY TASKS YOU RUN FROM THE TERMINAL MUST SET THE EVIRONMENT NAME**
The ```environment_variables.php``` generated by this recipe will look like this:

```
    // Environment Variables for application production_site 
    putenv("ANOTHER_API_KEY hello-monkey!");
    putenv("FUEL_ENV production");
    putenv("GA_API_CACHE_TIME 1234");
    putenv("SOME_API_KEY nahnah");
```
